Hello! I'm Mo, and I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Illinois at Chicago under the guidance of [Dr. Natalie Parde](https://www.natalieparde.com/index.html). My research spans various aspects of artificial intelligence, including machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics. I am particularly passionate about the evaluation and reproducibility of machine learning models, and I am a staunch advocate for Open Science, where I promote transparency, equity, and inclusivity in research practices.

I am dedicated to harnessing AI for the common good, tackling complex issues with systematic solutions. In addition to my primary research areas, I am actively engaged in the convergence of AI and healthcare. My projects have included developing predictive machine learning models for high-risk cancer patients and creating AI-driven tools for the early detection of diseases. I am also focused on using AI to enhance healthcare delivery and improve patient outcomes.
