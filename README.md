Hello! I'm Mo. I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Chicago, where I was mentored by [Dr. Natalie Parde](https://www.natalieparde.com/index.html). My research encompasses various areas within artificial intelligence such as machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics.

I am particularly committed to improving the evaluation and reproducibility of machine learning models. I am an advocate for Open Science, promoting transparency, equity, and inclusivity in research methodologies. I believe in the power of AI to serve the common good and enjoy solving complex problems with effective solutions.

Additionally, I have a keen interest in the intersection of AI and healthcare. This includes working on developing machine learning models to identify high-risk cancer patients and innovating AI-based tools for the early detection of diseases. My aim is to enhance healthcare delivery and improve patient outcomes through the application of artificial intelligence.
